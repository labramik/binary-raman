# Example Raman Phase Transition Analysis Paragraphs

This file contains examples of well-written analysis paragraphs from published research on solid-liquid phase transitions in binary systems. These demonstrate the expected style, structure, and level of detail.

## Example 1: Binary Mixture (x_DPA = 0.30)

For the binary mixture with molar fraction x_DPA = 0.30, the spectrum recorded between 203.15 and 252.15 K closely resembles that of pure DMA, exhibiting some minor band shifts and a new shoulder at 206 cm⁻¹. Interestingly, despite the relatively high concentration of DPA in the mixture, the contribution of the DPA component to the spectrum remains very minimal. At 253.15 K, the first peaks of liquid DPA appear at 604, 644, 761, 826, 920, 1132, and 2878 cm⁻¹. Subsequently, at 255.15 K, very subtle characteristic bands at 434 and 848 cm⁻¹, attributed to the DMA liquid phase appear, whereas all peaks of the solid DMA phase persist. As heating continues, the liquid phase bands of the liquid phase gradually grow, while the solid DMA phase bands diminish. At 273.15 K, the last bands of solid DMA are still observed at 218, 487, and 877 cm⁻¹, whereas no bands related to solid DPA are discernible. Finally, at 275.15 K, the spectrum of the mixture is equivalent to that obtained at room temperature, indicating the completion of the S-L phase transition.

**Key features demonstrated:**
- Opening statement with composition and temperature range
- Comparative language ("closely resembles")
- Specific band positions with detailed listing
- Chronological temperature progression
- Transition language ("Subsequently", "As heating continues", "Finally")
- Conclusion about phase transition completion
- Mentions of minor/subtle features

## Example 2: Binary Mixture (x_DPA = 0.77) - Eutectic Composition

Regarding the binary mixture with x_DPA = 0.77, the spectrum recorded at 193.15 K is mostly dominated by the typical features of solid DPA, with some of the strongest DMA marker bands visible at 220, 342, 489, 880, 1096 (shoulder), 1733 (shoulder), 2957, and 3027 cm⁻¹. The first spectral changes are detected already at 243.15 K. Specifically, the triplet of bands at 394–421 cm⁻¹ starts transforming into a single broadband centred at 410 cm⁻¹, characteristic of the DPA liquid phase. Similar behaviour is observed for the DPA solid bands at 762 and 1484 cm⁻¹. Additionally, the marker band of DPA liquid phase appears at 2939 cm⁻¹. At 250.15 K, the spectrum is already equivalent to the one obtained at room temperature, which is very similar to that of the pure DPA liquid phase. These results indicate that the S-L phase transition is very fast, and both compounds melt simultaneously as expected for the eutectic composition.

**Key features demonstrated:**
- Opening with composition and initial temperature
- Description of dominant component with minority component features
- Specific mention of spectral features (triplet, broadband, shoulder)
- Detailed band transformations
- Rapid transition description
- Scientific interpretation (eutectic behavior)

## Example 3: High Purity Mixture (x_DPA = 0.95)

Finally, for the mixture with a composition of x_DPA = 0.95, the spectrum taken at 193.15 K is essentially identical to that of solid DPA, with some very minor contribution from the DMA solid phase, evidenced by the very subtle bands at 220, 882 (shoulder), 1775 (shoulder), and 3028 cm⁻¹. At 254.15 K, the first modifications related to the beginning of the S-L phase transition become visible in the spectrum. Specifically, bands at 1281 (sh.), and 2938 cm⁻¹, characteristic of liquid DPA appear as well as the bands at 609 (shoulder), 650 (broad), and 831 cm⁻¹ related to both liquid phases. At 255.15 K, the S-L transition continues to progress, and by 256.15 K, the spectrum is already equivalent to that obtained at room temperature, indicating complete phase transition.

**Key features demonstrated:**
- Opening describing spectrum similarity
- Indication of minor component contribution
- Use of abbreviations (sh. for shoulder)
- Band width descriptors (broad)
- Continuous progression through temperatures
- Clear conclusion statement

## Example 4: Pure Compound (DMA)

Raman spectroscopy did not show clear signs of polymorphism, a result that is consistent with DSC results, where only a very subtle event is detected before the solid–liquid phase transition, and with HSM data. The sample is in the solid phase at 223.15 and 280.15 K. The onset temperature of the S-L transformation is 280.15 K and 282.15 K. At 282.15 K, Raman bands related to the liquid form appear at 280, 368, 432, 608, 646, 829, 849, 1065, and 1083 cm⁻¹, as well as overall broadening of the spectral feature at 2800–3050 cm⁻¹ making it appear more similar to that of the liquid phase. Nevertheless, at this temperature all strong Raman features of the solid phase are still clearly observable. On the other hand, by 285.15 K, all bands of the solid state have disappeared, indicating that the S-L transformation is complete.

**Key features demonstrated:**
- Opening with polymorphism discussion and cross-technique validation
- Specific temperature ranges for solid phase
- Onset temperature specification
- Band listing for liquid phase appearance
- Description of spectral broadening
- Contrast language ("Nevertheless", "On the other hand")
- Clear completion statement

## Example 5: Pure Compound (DPA)

The first noteworthy indications of the beginning of the S-L transition in the spectra of pure DPA appear at 258.15 K, when the bands of the liquid phase become visible at 250, 305, and 604 cm⁻¹ and the peak at 2919 cm⁻¹ of the solid phase becomes notably smaller. The phase transition continues to evolve until 259.15 K, when the spectrum becomes equivalent to the room-temperature spectrum, indicating that the sample is fully liquid.

**Key features demonstrated:**
- Concise opening statement
- Specific first indication temperature
- Both appearance and disappearance observations
- Brief but complete description
- Clear conclusion

## Style Guidelines Summary

Based on these examples:

1. **Opening**: Always state composition/sample type and initial temperature range
2. **Chronological flow**: Progress through temperatures in order
3. **Specificity**: Include all relevant band positions
4. **Descriptors**: Use appropriate qualifiers (subtle, strong, broad, shoulder, triplet)
5. **Comparative language**: "resembles", "equivalent to", "very similar to", "closely matches"
6. **Transition markers**: "Subsequently", "As heating continues", "Finally", "Nevertheless", "On the other hand"
7. **Scientific notation**: Use subscripts (x_DPA), proper units (cm⁻¹, K)
8. **Interpretation**: End with conclusion about phase transition (completion, behavior type)
9. **Feature notation**: Use "(shoulder)" or "(sh.)", "(broad)", "(triplet)" as appropriate
10. **Precision**: Provide exact temperatures and wavenumbers
